	<p>Assalamualaikum, I’m the creator of this website for my assignment purposes for the subject IMD311 (Introduction to Web Content Management & Design). My name is Ain Nuha binti Abdullah, a student from the Faculty of Information Management at UiTM Machang, Kelantan. For this assignment, we are required to create an HTML website using the authoring tool Sublime. The HTML pages should include all the codes that we have learned so far. The completed website contains the following: Home Page, Biodata, Experience, Education, Family, Gallery, and other necessary pages. </p>
	<p>Therefore, I would like to thank Allah S.W.T for successfully completing this assignment on time. Not to be forgotten are those of my friends who together help in giving moral support and explanations in order to understand every task and topic on this subject. Also, this assignment wouldn't be completed without the guidance and knowledge from my lecturer. A big thanks to the person who introduced this subject, Miss Nur Ainatul Mardiah binti Mat Nawi, for her teachings. She also gives a lot of advice on how to finish this assignment through an online platform. Hopefully, Miss can accept this individual assignment. That’s all from me. Thank you.</p>
